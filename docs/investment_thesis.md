# Investment Thesis 

I've realized that after while being in various ecosystems, 
I can finally give back, drive founders visions through angel checks, being LP, give helpful insights &c,
where I can be value add and show you some tricks and hacks, to grow your product.

I've started slowly gaining exposure in next-gen industries, 
this is just concept list, 
where I want to have my positions in future and it may change overtime.
In no particular order.

My prefered interests are in 
- Psyfin - I believe psychadelic finance will have transformative effect on wellbeings, on widespread scope.
- Microbiome - I'm personally biohacker and read a tons of research papers on gut-brain axis and I believe that helping either through "hardware" or software to give someone strong feedback loop on their metablism perfomance, one can change into better person.
- FMT - I believe FMT can cure various diseases.
- Longevity - In generally, I believe in slowing aging, stopping aging and reverse aging. Anything along this tunes, I'm interested to peak on your deck
- Wellbeing in generall - I guess there will be tons of various products who can help one to feel great, through habits & routine building, supplements, performing workouts, inner mental space building. 
- RemoteFirst stack - I'm already exposed and backin some premium talents at pre-seed & seed stages and love to learn more if you are looking for expanding a bit.
- Genomics/SynBio - I guess it's quite early for me, but happy to chat on this page.
- Space - We are all gonna make it there, so why not make highway faster? Ping me if you have something on this.
- Crypto - I'm bit overexposed here, but I guess I can enter another rocketship, if you are building one!
- Blockchain Gaming - I'm bit bullish, what can various turn-based gmames, MMORPG concepts from 90s can bring on table leveraging nowadays tech with right incentive structure
