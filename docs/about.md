# About 🌈

Being able to design, prototype, code, 💅 polish, build, deploy and scale. 
I keep my mind calm, when there is known scenario ahead including [antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility). I feel myself comfortable on position of [Developer Advocate](https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-is-the-job-of-a-developer-advocate), Backend engineer and UX advocate.
