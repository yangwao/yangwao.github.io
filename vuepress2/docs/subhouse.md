# SubHouse üè°

- I've got that idea that would be amazing to have hackerhouses. Best, have nice audience inside of them.

- Nurturing [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) influential founders at one place funded from [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/)/[Kusama](https://kusama.network/) Treasury

### Inspiration
Inspired by [HackBase coming from CCC / Hackerspaces movement](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hackbase) & [CreatorCabins](https://twitter.com/creatorcabins) 

We would like to set affordable living & cover food costs for those who are super willing contribute to Polkadot/Kusama/Substrate ecosystem and to take charge relocate to subHouse and be co-located at strong hive of substrate wisdom and hard working peers.

### Running Costs

Running costs should be covered by operator, which can go and ask Treasury for reimbruss costs for doing this amazing service in legacy world and slowly forming small crypto hyper-local enclaves before entact [network unions](https://1729.com/network-union/)

Residency can be shared among NFT artists who are bringing right tribe / crypto religion and help them to create their artwork with better conditions, like subsidized rent & food costs.

### Primary drivers
- exchange of open knowledge to drive positive sum games for ecosystem
- high quality builder peers to share Substrate ecosystem wisdom 
- mutual deep relationship between projects
- fostering relationship by longer stay 4-12 weeks
- focused on one's wellbeing.
