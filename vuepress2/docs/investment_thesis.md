# Investment Thesis 

[[toc]]

## Reasoning
I've realized, that after while, being in various ecosystems, 
**I can finally give back**, drive founders visions through **angel checks, being LP, give helpful insights &c,**
where I can be value add and show you some tricks and hacks, to grow your product.

## Conceptualization
I've started slowly gaining exposure in next-gen industries, 
this is just concept list, 
where I want to have **my positions in future and it may change overtime.**
In no particular order.

I'm happy to learn on your investment thesis and ask why.

# **My prefered interests are in**

## Psyfin
- I believe psychadelic finance will have transformative effect on wellbeings, on widespread scope.

## Microbiome
- I'm personally biohacker and read a tons of research papers on gut-brain axis and I believe that helping either through "hardware" or software to give someone strong feedback loop on their metablism perfomance, one can change into better person.

## FMT
- I believe FMT can cure various diseases.

## Longevity
- In general, I believe in slowing aging, stopping aging and reverse aging. Anything along this tunes, I'm interested to peak on your deck

## Wellbeing in general
- I guess there will be tons of various products who can help one to feel great, through habits & routine building, supplements, performing workouts, inner mental space building. 

## RemoteFirst stack
- I'm already exposed and backin some premium talents at pre-seed & seed stages and love to learn more if you are looking for expanding a bit.

## Genomics/SynBio
- I guess it's quite early for me, but happy to chat on this page.

## Reforestation
- I'm always believer that we need to put focus on saving planet. It's simple, **Save the planet, get rich.**. I'm interested in ways to scale efforts to bring back green climate and drive Solarpunk representations.

## Space
- We are all gonna make it there, so why not make highway faster? **Ping me if you have something on this.**

## Crypto
- I'm bit overexposed here and I guess I can enter another rocketship, if you are building one!

## Blockchain Gaming
- I'm bit bullish, what can various turn-based gmames, **MMORPG concepts from 90s can bring on table** leveraging nowadays tech with right incentive structure

## Metaverse
- I believe that various super-immersive experiences with shared objects, **might be "game-changer" for legacy industries.**
 
## Knowledge economy
- Picks and shovels works here (RoamResearch, Obsidian, Meta, Xanadu, Kanopi, &c). Building layer, plugin, interface? I'm keen to chat.

## Brain Computer Interface (BCI)
- I've been playing with BCI and P300 back in 2011, been positively shocked what it can deliver and especially how it helps out disabled people to access legacy world. BCI recently have picked [up wind](https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-implant-enables-paralyzed-man-to-communicate-thoughts-via-imaginary-handwriting)[1](https://github.com/Ildaron/ironbci). With recent BCI upgrades human beings could gain significant edge over their wellbeing, insights to their insideOps, better understanding why they are doing what they are doing, raise bar for self-awarness and make whole feedback loop much stronger and exact. For example check retail helmet from [Kernel Flow, costs around $100k](https://www.kernel.com/own-flow), which becomes more affordable in few years as technologic deflation kicks in. On other side, one can have way better understanding of real enviroment around themselves plus ability to control various motoric/robotic devices around without using their muscular systems at all. Try imagine further possibilities.

## Infrastructure
- I've studied few peer reviewed science papers on upcoming black swan events comes down against society and I've learned where we need put emphasis on investments and why.

## eVTOLs

- I believe that electric VTOLs would have significant impact how transportations works inside cities, outskirt and on sub-urban travels. It might be way better and affordable option for transportation as autonomous cars would be fairly great, but their limitation is need to follow particular pathway on the road which are quite constrainted. Concept opens ability for on-demand aviation transportation system. [Uber Elevate is fair example of traction](https://www.uber.com/us/en/elevate/). [eVTOLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVTOL) doesn't inheritently stay only for passinb by human corpses, strong case could be for eVTOL UAV delivery service. Probably we are just on the early phase of this. Imagine instead of traveling between city center and airport, you can cut on average 50 minutes to 10 minutes.

# Funding type
Mostly, I'm looking to back you in crypto-native way, if possible.
Otherway around, AngelList should be supporting USDC.
