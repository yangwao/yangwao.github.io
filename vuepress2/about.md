# About 🌈

This is supposed to be summary of my (digital) wellbeing 💆‍♂️.

> **Zoom in, you will see chaos.**

> **Zoom out, you will start seeing system.**

> **Vice versa, rinse and repeat.**

- I'm constantly exploring possibilities and looking for changes in (knowledge) graph(s).
- Constantly trying cultivating of the self, meditate and staying in touch with the harmonies of the cosmos to drive my inner freedom.
- Being soft and gentle will teach you a lesson in every spectrum of your life.
- I'm trying to remove my false knowledge which might weights me like execssive boundaries, supersittions and prejudices.

### I've learned
- That the true and highest knowledge is to know that one does not and cannot know everything. It is to understand the limitations of words and the range of human comprehension. 
- To accept that not-knowing and treat it as a gift. Because knowing what you don't know is wisdom.
- [Concept of Wuwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei), which involves way to leran the value of stillnes by observing the natural world.
- Non-contending as a Non-Action and you can beautifully observe it how water behaves. Staying still and patient, water can conquer anything and benefit a myriad of other things. It's never in a competition, it never strives to ge to the top, glad to flow beneath plants and soil and giving them  life. Water brings moisture to every place, learned to treat everyone as equals, wheter a friend or a stranger.
- Ready to give and expect nothing in return.
- Being empty vessel containing everything and nothing simultaneously 
- To believe in the cyclical nature of things, sundwon must always follow sunrise, success must follow failure and vice versa. 
- Things to let go.
- To understand others is wisdom; to know self is illumination. To vanquish others requires force; to vanquish self requires strength.
- summarize all above, is main treasures of Taoism. Non-Action, Wordlessness and Non_contending. That's how I've learned fight chaos of life and find quiet harmony amidst it.

> “To a mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders.” -- **Lao-Tzu**
